We will learn Angular 2 by taking small incremental steps. But before we start with Angular 2 we will first learn TypeScript 1.5:

Soon I will start releasing a series of video tutorials in which we will cover these projects. But you can start now by going through the code.

I am using VSCode as my Editor, just open the project file in VSCode. Read the readme.txt file in each project.

Download VSCode from:

We will also cover how to use Polymer Web Components with Angular 2 UI and Firebase as the backend:
